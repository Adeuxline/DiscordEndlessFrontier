```
Additional instructors improve the rate at which units are trained.

__**Guild Battles**__

**Guild Wars**

2 wars are opened daily at 09:00 and 21:00 UTC. These stay open for 24 hours. Members have 2 tickets to attack per war. In the event of a draw the weaker guild wins.

When defending the lowest available group of 40 support units will be used. If 40 units are not available a higher tier unit will be used.

**Guild Raids**

There are 2 Guild Raids, both have 5 stages. Each stage has 4 battles as a part of it. It is possible to open up to 3 raids per day, a maximum of 2 for any single raid.

Winning a battle gives every member some pet fragments: 

Ancient Ruins - Skole, Harping, Gnome, Belial
Burning Earth - Lavark, Furion, Hellyme, Bahat 

Additionally members receive one of :ef_gc:, :ef_hc:, :ef_gem: and Raid Coins. Later stages provide higher rewards.

*Wihtout fire resistance, Burning Earth is almost impossible**
