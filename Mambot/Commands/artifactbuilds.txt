.acr !artifactbuilds %user% typed `!artifactbuilds`. This covers a selection of the most common artifact builds people use. It relies on having the full 27 slots and all 6\* artifacts so is aimed at MidGame.

The guide will reference upgrading certain artifacts. These are recommendation for upgrading to their maximum level using honor coins (+50 for 6\*, +70 for 6\* T1, +90 for 6\* T2).

__**6\* / 6\* T1 Builds**__
```
6  | Can be any tribe units, but Orc and
6  | Elf are probably recommended.
4  King of Beasts
4  Ancient Outland Beasts
4  Legacy of Abundance
3  The Ruler of Darkness
```
**Recommended Upgrade Order**
One each of Quest Upgrade Cost and Quest Open Gold Reduction. One of Quest Gold Acquisition is also helpful.

These should ideally be from Legacy of Abundance or your primary race for attack power and other buffs. Alternatively Frost Knight is an excellent choice as it is a powerful lategame race.

``` 
6  | Can be any tribe units, but Orc, 
6  | Elf and one other are probably
6  | recommended.

1  Ancient Outland Beast's Blunt Force
 ```
**Recommended Upgrade Order**
 - Ancient Outland Beast's Blunt Force
 - Additional Quest Upgrade Cost, Quest Open Gold Reduction and Quest Gold Acquisition. One of which should also boost your primary Tribe's attack power.
