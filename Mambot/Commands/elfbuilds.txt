**Notes**

 - Sword Dancer can be substituted in for the Druid in either of the above.
 - Supports should only have a minority of medals and generally aim for good breakpoints that benefit the whole team.
 - Please see this page on reddit for more information on breakpoints - <http://bit.ly/2lvOGKK>
 - Some more detailed builds can be found using !elfbuildold1 and !elfbuildold2, however these aren't recently updated.
