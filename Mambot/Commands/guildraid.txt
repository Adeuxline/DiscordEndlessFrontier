**Basic Overview**

There are 3 Guild Raids. Each stage has 4 battles as a part of it. It is possible to open up to 3 raids per day, a maximum of 2 for any single raid. 
Raids may be opened by Elder, Co-Leader or Leader guild ranks.

Winning a battle gives every member some pet fragments: 

Ancient Ruins stage 1-5  - Skole, Harping, Gnome, Belial
Burning Earth stage 1-5  - Lavark, Furion, Hellyme, Bahat 
Swamp of Death stage 1-5 - Tarad, Neru, Gorgon, Beel
Ancient Ruins stage 6-8  - Senior Skole, Senior Harping, Senior Gnome, Senior Belial
Burning Earth stage 6-8  - Senior Lavark, Senior Furion, Senior Hellyme, Senior Bahat

Additionally members receive :ef_gc:, :ef_gem: and Raid Coins. Later stages provide higher rewards.
Most important attribute, that affects both damage and hp of troops during Guild Raid, is Knightage Level of attacker. Burning Earth and Swamp of Death also require Fire and Nature Resist, respectively. You can further increase your damage by acquiring pets that increase stats in Guild Raid, Instructor Pets, and Pets that boost raid skill efficiency.
