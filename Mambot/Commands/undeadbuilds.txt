**Notes**

 - Dark Spirit supports make your team faster, but Dark Elf supports make your team go further due to tribe friendliness.
 - Supports should only have a minority of medals and generally aim for good breakpoints that benefit the whole team.
 - Please see this page on reddit for more information on breakpoints - <http://bit.ly/2lvOGKK>
