.acr !petguide %user% typed `!petguide`. A basic overview of pets in the game.

**Note** All pet skills are always active. "Main Pet" has its skills doubled. "Revival Pet" skills are doubled at revival.

Prioritize Late Game, then Mid Game, then Early Game. Within each section, better pets are generally listed first. Don't fret to buy additional tickets every day if you can afford it.

**First steps** Get mambo to 5\*, farm others untill you have better options
`Mambo`           Provides basic gold buff, mandatory pet for a lot SH stages. 

**Early Game** Get Icy and Tinkey to 5\*, farm others if no mid/late game pets open
`Icy`              Allows Priests 5x skill from the time shop, and trigger if stage ##10 skipped.
`Tinkey`           Adds fairy speed buff and allows skip chance to trigger from time shop.

`Sarah`            Adds valkyrie speed buff and improves Hero Sword(raid damage buff skill) efficiency.

**Guild Raid Damage**

A few pets offer additional guild raid damage, the efpetguide1 below lists these.

**Spirit Awakening / Inner Passion Pets**

Start appearing from SH stage 13-15, very late game.

**Pet Shop**

The pet shop is an expensive method of acquiring late game pets. Early game it should perhaps be avoided, however as spare currency is built up, it is worth considering.
