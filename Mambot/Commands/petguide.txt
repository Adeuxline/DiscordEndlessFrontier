.acr !petguide %user% typed `!petguide`. A basic overview of pets in the game.

**Note** All pet skills are always active. "Main Pet" has its skills doubled. "Revival Pet" skills are doubled at revival.

Prioritize Late Game, then Mid Game, then Early Game. Within each section, better pets are generally listed first. The numbers after the name are the KLVL required to farm.

**Early Game** Get one to 5\*, farm if no mid/late game pets open

`Piggy      8, 24` Provides basic gold buff
`Indy      30, 48` Useful for Elf core, strengthens Wolf Warrior.

`Icy       58, 76` Allows Priests 5x skill from the time shop, and trigger if stage ##10 skipped.

**Guild Raid Damage**

A few pets offer additional guild raid damage, the efpetguide1 below lists these.

**Spirit Awakening / Inner Passion Pets**

Start appearing from SH stage 13-15, very late game.

**Pet Shop**

The pet shop is an expensive method of acquiring late game pets. Early game it should perhaps be avoided, however as spare currency is built up, it is worth considering.
