.greetdmmsg Hello, %user%, welcome to the Endless Frontier discord server! 

__**Server Rules**__

1. Be friendly, polite and respect each other. We have younger members so keep language clean.
2. Don't talk about cheats, hacks, exploits or ways to bypass ads. 
3. In the guild recruitment channels only 1 message, per guild, per day.

__**Server Usage Guide**__

*Want to chat to other players?*
If it's about the game use `#ef_general`, anything else can go in `#offtopic`. 

*After some help?* 
Ask any questions you have in `#ask_anything`, someone is normally around to help. We've also got a bunch of guides, type `!commands` in `#commands` for a full list.

*Looking for a guild or help with the Tower of Trials?*
Grant yourself a server role using `.iam Server #` in `#commands`. This will make some server specific channels for your server appear.
