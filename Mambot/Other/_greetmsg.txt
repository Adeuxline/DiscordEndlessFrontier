.greetdmmsg Hello, %user%, welcome to the Endless Frontier discord server! 


**__Server Rules__**

Make sure to read through the Rules Channel `#rules`. You will know the rules, learn about the Support Channel and about the warning System.


**__Server Usage Guide__**

*Looking for a guild, help with the Tower of Trials or just want to Chat to People on your Server?*

Grant yourself a server role using `.iam Server #` in `#commands`. This will make some server specific channels for your server appear.

*Stage Roles*

You can set yourself a role corresponding to your highest Stage reached in the Game by using `.iam Stage #` in `#commands`. Stages go up in Steps by 1000 until Stage 10000. For Example, if your highest Stage is 4750, you would type `.iam Stage 4000`. 

*Want to chat to other players?*

If it's about the game use `#ef_general`, anything else can go in `#offtopic`. 

*After some help?* 

Ask any questions you have in `#ask_anything`, someone is normally around to help. We've also got a bunch of guides, type `!commands` in `#commands` for a full list.
